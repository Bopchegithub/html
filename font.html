<p id="p1">About
<p>According to the Oxford English Dictionary (third edition 2009), 
    the name "India" is derived from the Classical Latin India,
     a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east;
     and in turn derived successively from: 
    Hellenistic Greek India ( Ἰνδία); 
    ancient Greek Indos ( Ἰνδός); Old Persian Hindush,
     an eastern province of the Achaemenid empire; 
    and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit Sindhu, or "river," specifically the Indus River and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.
     The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi (Ἰνδοί), 
    which translates as "The people of the Indus".
